The dataset includes information such as shipment modes, vendors, delivery dates, freight costs, and product weights across multiple countries. The primary objective of the analysis was to uncover insights related to shipment efficiency, vendor performance, and cost distribution. Through this analysis, we identified the most common shipment modes, top-performing vendors, countries with the highest delivery values, and the relationship between freight cost and shipment weight. We also assessed delivery timeliness by calculating delays between scheduled and actual delivery dates. The findings from this EDA can help improve logistics planning, vendor selection, and cost optimization in future supply chain operations."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The project aims to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on the SCMS Delivery History Dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in global supply chain operations.
